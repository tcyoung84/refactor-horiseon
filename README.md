# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

As a marketing agency, the client has asked us to refactor the codebase of their website to follow accessibility standards so the site is optimized for search engines.

The client has also requested we consolidate the CSS selectors and properties to follow semantic structure. Added comments to CSS, as well.

The website appearance and function has not changed in any way. 

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
